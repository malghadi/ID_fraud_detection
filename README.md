# ID_fraud_detection
## Introduction  <br />
In this paper, we propose two anomaly detection models for
identity documents verification, comprising contrastive and adversarial learning frameworks.
The first proposed model learns the representations in a con-
trastive learning manner, named as contrastive based fraud de-
tection model (ContFD), and the second model learns the rep-
resentations based on an adversarial setting, which is named as
constrained-adversary based fraud detection model (AdvFD).
Both models work to well classify authentic (real) and forged
(fake) identity documents.
